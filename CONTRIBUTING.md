# Contributing to 'Ask These Questions'

## General Guidelines
* All bullet points should be in the form of a _question_ directed at the interviewer
 * Instead of, "Tell me about a time...", write it as, "Can you tell me about a time...?"
 * This is for the sake of consistency
* At this time, questions must be applicable to someone applying for a job as a software developer, software engineer, programmer, etc.
 * If there is community interest, this can always be expanded to other fields or specialties in the future.  There are currently no plans to support this.
* Questions in the document are allowed subtext or footnotes if necessary to further describe or highlight value
* Place all questions in their best fit category
 * If there truly is no best fit category, please use 'Other' or see [Contributing Categories](#contributing-categories)
* No duplicates.  Feel free to expand on an existing question instead.
