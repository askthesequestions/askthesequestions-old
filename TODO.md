A list of things to do to make this a proper reference site.

 * Use Travis to generate the index.html file on push to gh-pages
 * Break categories into folders, or at least into separate files per category, as to allow easier management and page generation
 * Allow a user managed list (cookies are fine).  Users can highlight and cross out specific bullet points before exporting the list.
