A list of things to do to make this a proper reference site.

 * Use Travis or some automation tool to generate the index.html file on push to gh-pages
 * Break categories into folders or into separate files per category, as to allow easier management and page generation
 * Allow a user managed list (cookies are fine).  Users can highlight and cross out specific bullet points before exporting the list.
  * This should be to help with exporting for printing so users can more easily dial in their questions for specific positions or companies
  * Devil's advocate: a plain old highlighter and pen work just fine too
